# SQLite challenge


This is a challenge I made for myself to learn more about sql.
Rules are simple:

1. Make a naive implementation of sqlite, no file support, no advanced data structures (B-tree)
2. Use two resources https://www.sqlite.org and https://sqlbolt.com, these pages especially interesting:
https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html, https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html
I hope I am not gonna look at actual implementation before challenge is complete
3. Have fun
